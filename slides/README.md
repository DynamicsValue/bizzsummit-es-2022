# FakeXrmEasy Bizz Summit ES 2022 Slides

The slides of my talk at BizzSummit ES 2022.

## Building
--------------------------

Yes! You can build these slides into a PDF or SPA app for presenting.

The slides are Markdown based + CSS. 

They're built using an awesome [VS Code extension called Marp](https://marp.app/). If that tool is also helpful to you, please donate to them!

- Just install it

- Open VS Code from the ./slides/ folder

- And open preview window of the slides.md file

Done!
